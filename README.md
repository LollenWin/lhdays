# Longhorn Days
This project aims to bring 2002 Longhorn Days concepts to life. The project is based on 4020 but isnt just available as an .iso file. It is also a transformation pack.
If you install it with the transformation pack installer, it is recommended you use builds 4000 to 4093. i386 repacks also work.
I have another project called Plexify. You can check it on my archive.org page. (it isnt there yet)

Please use this at your own risk.
